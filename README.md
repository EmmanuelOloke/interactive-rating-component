This is a solution to the [Interactive rating component Challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI/hub/interactive-rating-component-rkehmaI4q). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

I'm transitioning back into Full-Time Web Development after a long hiatus away from the tech industry. From experience I know the fastest way to learn/relearn any skill is through consistent building and that is why I've found Front End Mentor Challenges to be the perfect fit for me at this stage in my career journey.

This is the tenth challenge I'm attempting. My completion time is getting shorter so I'm definitely excited about that.

## The Challenge

- Build out the Interactive rating component Challenge at [https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI/hub/interactive-rating-component-rkehmaI4q] as close to the original designs as possible.
